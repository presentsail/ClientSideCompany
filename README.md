# ClientSideCompany Modpack

Welcome to presentsail's first modpack! It contains some client-side 
quality of life mods that can be tacked on to almost any mod profile. 
Please visit their pages to learn how to use them. This modpack was 
made to improve the experience of the game, while not departing too 
far from the vanilla experience. Joining vanilla players should 
still be possible. Turn off individual mods as necessary.

## Latest Change
### Verion 1.2.0

Added the following mods to the pack:

- ShipLoot

Also updated the README section to only show the latest entry in the 
CHANGELOG tab, not all of them.
