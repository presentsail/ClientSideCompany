# ClientSideCompany Modpack

Welcome to presentsail's first modpack! It contains some client-side 
quality of life mods that can be tacked on to almost any mod profile. 
Please visit their pages to learn how to use them. This modpack was 
made to improve the experience of the game, while not departing too 
far from the vanilla experience. Joining vanilla players should 
still be possible. Turn off individual mods as necessary.

This modpack is only a list of mods and does not itself add any 
functionality. Disabling or removing it will not affect anything.

## Latest Change
